After graduation, he joined Baidu as R&D engineer of the Ministry of the Web search; subsequently, he transferred to IT department, and committed to the development of workflow software which was used by [Baidu Phoenix Nest](http://e.baidu.com/) and lots of systems. As an IBMer, he is the team lead in China of [Platform Symphony](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/technicalcomputing/platformcomputing/products/symphon...(line truncated)...\r\n\r\n### Interests\r\n\r\nDistributed Computing, Grid, Cloud, Project Management (PMP©) \r\n\r\n### Experience\r\n\r\n* **Advisory Software Engineer**: Platform Computing, an IBM company (2014/07 ~ Present) at Beijing\r\n* **Team Lead of CE & L3**: Platform Computing, an IBM company (2014/06 ~ Present) at Beijing\r\n* **Team Lead of CE**: Platform Computing, an IBM company (2011/11 ~ 2014/06) at Beijing\r\n* **Software Engineer**: Platform Computing (2010/09 ~ 2011/11) at Beijing\r\n* **Software Engineer**: Baidu (2008/06 ~ 2010/08) at Beijing\r\n* **Researcher**: Platform Computing Grid Technology Research Center at Jilin University (2005/09 ~ 2008/06) at Changchun\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\n\r\n**Phone**: N/A; **E-mail**: <mada.jlu@hotmail.com>; **MSN**: <mada.jlu@hotmail.com> \r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n__Multiple Tasks in One Service Instance (MTS)__\r\n\r\nIn IBM Platform Symphony, it's used to be one process for each running task in compute\r\nhost; it's un-convinced for user to share data & computing result. With MTS feature, there\r\nis only one service instance/process for all running tasks from the same job or application.\r\nAs the owner of the project, worked on drafting FS, coding and driving the release.\r\n\r\n__Tools__: C/C++, GDB, gtest, ACE\r\n\r\n__Service Affinity Group (SAG)__\r\n\r\nThe target of this project is to avoid the overhead when slots transfer between burst jobs,\r\nby allowing different jobs in the same SAG will run on the same service instance where the\r\ndata has previously been loaded. As the owner of the project, worked on drafting FS,\r\ncoding and driving the release.\r\n\r\n__Tools__: C/C++, Java, GDB, gtest, ACE\r\n\r\n__Recursive Workload__\r\n\r\nCustomer's workload pattern is recursive, where a task (parent task) will create another\r\njob (child job) and generate more tasks (child tasks) that are submitted to the child job.\r\nAfter post-submission processing, parent task will wait for its child tasks to complete.\r\nWhile it waits, the compute slot is wasted. To increase resource usage, this feature allows\r\na running task to yield the slot(s), which can be used to run the tasks of its direct\r\ndescendants. As local peer, worked with Toronto team on coding, bug fix and driving\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\n__Tools__: C/C++, Java, GDB, gtest, ACE\r\n\r\n__R/Python integration__\r\n\r\nR & Python are two major integration projects. IBM Platform symphony provides lots of\r\nAPI for user to submit/create task to the cluster system. The purpose of integration\r\nproject is to provide a native API in those programming language. As a project member,\r\nworked on researching, coding & bug fix.\r\n\r\n__Tools__: C/C++, R/Python, GDB\r\n\r\n__20K cores per application (Multiple-SSM)__\r\n\r\nThe multi-ssm feature provides better scalability by employing multiple physical\r\napplications to do the real work. Jobs created in logical application are logical jobs, which\r\ninternally be mapped to a physical job of one physical application, or physical jobs of\r\nmultiple physical applications. Tasks of a logical job will be redirected to the related\r\nphysical job(s). Take part in the project as a freshman, worked on coding and unit testing;\r\nand help QA on system test.\r\n\r\n__Tools__: C/C++, R/Python, GDB\r\n\r\n__Workflow form engine__\r\n\r\nIn workflow, forms engine is another key module to submit, process and display data. The\r\npurpose of this project is to provide a WYSIWYG system for administrator to manage\r\nworkflow forms, a data processing system to handle user's input and a display system to\r\ngenerate form according to workflow's status and data. As the owner of project, worked\r\non researching, design and coding.\r\n\r\n__Tools__: JEE, MySQL, Shark (workflow), JavaScript/Html/Css\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n\r\n__Jilin University__\r\nMaster, Computer Science and technology 2005 – 2008\r\n\r\n1. “Customized Plug-in Modules in Meta-scheduler CSF4 for Life Sciences Applications”, Special Issue on Life Science Grid Computing of New Generation Computing, Vol. 25-4, August 2007\r\n2. “VJM - A Deadlock Free Resource Co-allocation Model for Cross Domain Parallel Jobs”, HPC Asia 2007\r\n3. “VJM - A Deadlock Free Resource Co-allocation Model for Cross Domain Parallel Jobs”, NBCR Summer Institute 2007\r\n4. “VJM - A Deadlock Free Resource Co-allocation Model for Cross Domain\r\nParallel Jobs”, Journal of Software, pending\r\n\r\n__JiLin University__\r\nBS, Computer Science and technology 2001 – 2005\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
